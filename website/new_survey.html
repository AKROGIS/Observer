	<h3>Maps and Protocols</h3>
	    <p>Instructions on what to do if you cannot find what you need in the list of
			<a href="protocols/">protocols</a> or <a href="maps/">basemaps</a> on the server.

	    <strong>Contact <a href="mailto:regan_sarwas@nps.gov">AKR GIS</a></strong>.
		<p>We are happy to help.
		Creating a new map or survey protocol is fast and efficient for us as long as you can communicate your needs.</p>
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    <strong>Thanks, but I want to do it myself.</strong>

				<h4>Protocols</h4>

	    <p>The protocol file define your survey, most importantly it specifies what features that you can collect,
			and the attributes of those features.
			You must have a protocol file to create a survey and collect data.</p>

		<p>The easiest way to create a new protocol is to copy one of the <a href="protocols/">existing protocols</a>
		and then edit it to meet your needs in a text editor like Notepad, <a href="https://notepad-plus-plus.org/">Notepad++</a>
		or <a href="https://atom.io/">atom</a> (do not use MS Word).
		The <a href="ProtocolSpecificationV2.html">Protocol Specification</a> is the definitive guide to the content and
		format of a protocol file.  The specifications closely mirror the application code, and while it is long and boring,
		it is defines exactly what is allowed and what is not.
		The <a href="ProtocolGuide.html">Protocol Guide</a> provides a more readable discussion of some of
		the considerations in making a protocol file suitable for your needs.

		<p>The protocol file must be a valid <a href="http://json.org/">JSON</a> file, a single misplaced comma will
		cause it to fail to load in the app.
		You should validate it first by using an <a href="http://jsonlint.com/">online validator</a>.

		<p>Once you have a valid protocol, you can use iTunes to load it onto your device.
		It will then appear in the list of local protocols in your app.
		If you want your protocol to appear in the list of protocols available to all users
		<a href="mailto:regan_sarwas@nps.gov">contact me</a> and I will load it on the server.

		<p>The Park Observer app is not very friendly when you feed it a protocol that does not meet the specifications.
			It usually just crashes without any explanation. Always thoroughly test your protocols before doing real
			field work.  If you have a problem, consult the specification, and/or contact us for help.

		<p>While the <a href="surveys/">database for surveys</a> created from a protocol is created automatically when you sync your
			survey with the server, the associated layer files, mxd, map service and web map, are not.
		<a href="mailto:regan_sarwas@nps.gov">Contact us</a> if you would like those created for your protocol.
		Until then, you can go to \\akrgis.nps.gob\MapData\Observer to make a copy of the FGDB.</p>

	<h4>Maps</h4>
	<p>Basemaps can be created in ArcMap 10.1 or greater.
	The map is converted into a collection of small images at various scales for rapid
	rendering on the device.  You can use any image or vector datasets that you like in your map,
	however you can <strong>not</strong> use proprietary online basemaps (like Google, Bing, or ArcGIS).</p>
	<p>To create a basemap (aka tilecache) in ArcMap:
	<ol>
		<li>Turn on the tool: Select ArcMap Options... in the Customize menu item.  Then select the Sharing tab,
	and check the <em>Enable ArcGIS Runtime Tools</em></li>
	<li>Assemble your map - set symbology, labeling, scale dependencies, etc. to your liking.</li>
	<li>Zoom to the full extents of the area you would like to have in the tile cache.
	To minimize file size you should make the area as small as necessary.</li>
	<li>Export the map by selecting File->Share As->Tile Package from the ArcMap menu
	<ol type="a">
	  <li>Tile Package Tab<br>You will want to save the package to a file.  Give it any name you want.
	  When done, this file can be loaded into the app via iTunes.</li>
	  <li>Tile Format Tab<br>You will want to leave the Tile scheme as
	  <em>ArcGIS Online / Bing Maps / Google Maps </em> and Tile Format as <em>PNG</em>.
	  You will want to leave this at 17 or lower, unless you have a very small survey are, and need a very high
	  resolution of data. 5m resolution imagery will generally not look any better at more detail than level 17.
	  The higher the number, the longer the tile cache will take to generate, and the larger the tile package will be.
	  Generating an entire park at level 17 may take several hours or more. I would experiment with small areas and
	  low zoom levels to get a feel for how long it takes, and what zoom level gives you adequate resolution.
	  Be aware each increase in zoom level will quadruple the size and time it take to generate the tile cache.
	  <li>Item Description Tab<br>As a minimum, you are required to provide a Summary and Tags.</li>
	  </ol>
	  </li>
	  <li>Load the tile cache you just created on to your device with iTunes.
	  If you want the tile cache to appear in the list of basemaps available to all users <a href="mailto:regan_sarwas@nps.gov">contact me</a>.
	</li>
