	<h3>Adding Maps and Protocols</h3>
	    <p>Instructions on what to do if there is no protocol or basemap for your survey.</p>
		<ol>
			  <li>
	    <strong>Contact <a href="mailto:regan_sarwas@nps.gov">AKR GIS</a></strong>.
		<p>We are happy to help.
		Creating a new map or survey protocol is fast and efficient for us as long as you can communicate your needs.</p>
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    <strong>Thanks, but I want to do it myself.</strong>
		
				<h4><a href="protocols/">Protocols</a></h4>

	    <p>Protocols define your survey - you must have a protocol to collect data.  The
	    protocol defines the features that you can collect, and the attributes of those features.</p>
		
		<p>The easiest way to create a new protocol is to copy one of the <a href="protocols/">existing protocols</a>
		and then edit it in a text editor like notepad.  If you get stuck,
		try reading the <a href="ProtocolSpecification.html">specification for the protocol file</a></p>
		
		<p>A Protocol should have a unique name and version.  To avoid confusion, the file name should match the name attribute
		inside the file, but this is not required.
		Protocols have a major and minor version number.  Both are integers separated by a decimal point.
		A change in the major version number indicates a change in the database schema.  Use the minor version number for all other changes.</p>
		
		<p>Protocols create a FGDB on the server the first time a new major version is synced with the server.
		The name of the database is determined by the protocol name and the major version number.  The world will end
		if you try to sync a protocol with the same name and major version but different schema as an existing protocol.
		Please don't do that.</p>

		<p>The protocol must be a valid <a href="http://json.org/">JSON</a> file, or it will fail to load in the app.
		You should validate it first by using an <a href="http://jsonlint.com/">online validator</a>.</p>
		
		<p>Once you have a valid protocol, you can use iTunes to load it onto your device.
		It will then appear in the list of local protocols in your app.
		If you want your protocol to appear in the list of protocols available to all users
		<a href="mailto:regan_sarwas@nps.gov">contact me</a> and I will load it on the server.

		<p>While a database for the protocol is created automatically, the associated layer file, mxd, map service and web map, are not.
		<a href="mailto:regan_sarwas@nps.gov">Contact us</a> if you would like those created for your protocol.  Until then, you can
		go to \\akrgis.nps.gob\MapData\Observer to make a copy of the FGDB.</p>

	<h4><a href="maps/">Maps</a></h4>
	<p>Basemaps can be created in ArcMap 10.1 or greater.
	The map is converted into a collection of small images at various scales for rapid
	rendering on the device.  You can use any image or vector datasets that you like in your map,
	however you can <strong>not</strong> use proprietary online basemaps (like Google, Bing, or ArcGIS).</p>
	<p>To create a basemap (aka tilecache) in ArcMap:
	<ol><li>Turn on the tool: Select ArcMap Options... in the Customize menu item.  Then select the Sharing tab,
	and check the <em>Enable ArcGIS Runtime Tools</em></li>
	<li>Assemble your map - set symbology, labeling, scale dependencies, etc. to your liking.</li>
	<li>Zoom to the full extents of the area you would like to have in the tile cache.
	To minimize file size you should make the area as small as necessary.</li>
	</li>
	<li>Export the map by selecting File->Share As->Tile Package from the ArcMap menu
	<ol type="a">
	  <li>Tile Package Tab<br>You will want to save the package to a file.  Give it any name you want.
	  When done, this file can be loaded into the app via iTunes.</li>
	  <li>Tile Format Tab<br>You will want to leave the Tile scheme as
	  <em>ArcGIS Online / Bing Maps / Google Maps </em> and Tile Format as <em>PNG</em>.
	  You will want to leave this at 17 or lower, unless you have a very small survey are, and need a very high
	  resolution of data. 5m resolution imagery will generally not look any better at more detail than level 17.
	  The higher the number, the longer the tile cache will take to generate, and the larger the tile package will be.
	  Generating an entire park at level 17 may take several hours or more. I would experiment with small areas and
	  low zoom levels to get a feel for how long it takes, and what zoom level gives you adequate resolution.
	  Be aware each increase in zoom level will quadruple the size and time it take to generate the tile cache.
	  <li>Item Description Tab<br>As a minimum, you are required to provide a Summary and Tags.</li>
	  </ol>
	  </li>
	  <li>Load the tile cache you just created on to your device with iTunes.
	  If you want the tile cache to appear in the list of basemaps available to all users <a href="mailto:regan_sarwas@nps.gov">contact me</a>.
