				<h3>Major Changes</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<h4>Clean up styling of Status Text and make font size configurable</h4>
							<p>The text for on/off-transect (or observing/not-observing), as well as the transect totalizer
								is now a clean font on an opaque gray background.  The font size can be configured with options
								in the obsprot file, so individual surveys can control this to thier specifications.
						</li>
						<li>
							<h4>Configurable control for when the Mission Properties dialog is displayed for editing</h4>
							<p>Options can be configured in the protocol file.  You can display the MP editor at any of
								 the following times:
								<ol>
									<li>Start Recording - default is on</li>
									<li>Start Observing (first one after recording) default is off</li>
									<li>Start Re-Observing (after stop observing) default is on</li>
									<li>Stop Observing Prior (edits the track log segment being closed) - default is off</li>
									<li>Stop Observing - default is off</li>
								</ol>
								<p>There is a limitation where only one of the last two options is allowed.  If both are on, then the
								second one wins.  If you want to edit the prior track log segment, you can tap the marker on the map at
								the start of the segment.
						</li>
						<li>
							<h4>An alert is presented when deleting a feature</h4>
							<p>Deletion is an undoable action.  Since it is possible, especially in a bumpy aircraft, to accidentally tap
								the delete button when reviewing or editing an existing observation, the inconvenience of agreeing to <thead>
									deletion seems warranted.
								</thead>
						</li>
						<li>
							<h4>Allow 'off-transect' observations</h4>
							<p>Off-transect is synonymous with not observing, and on-transect equals observing. While it
								seems illogical to allow observations when you are not observing,  there are some surveys that
								want to be able to make observations at any time, regardless of the on/off-transect setting.
								This feature is enabled in the protocol file on a feature by feature basis.  The default is off.
						</li>
						<li>
							<h4>Increase spacing around the Mission Properties (partly cloudy) button</h4>
							<p>This helps to avoid mistaken taps.
						</li>
					</ul>
