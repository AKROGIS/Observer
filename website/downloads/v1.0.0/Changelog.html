				<h3>Major Changes</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<h4>Attributes can be entered when you start recording</h4>
							<p>Previously, the mission property attributes only comes up when you start observing, or change environment, it should also happen when you start recording.
								Previously, transects all start with a small segment on the wrong transect id, because the default when recording starts is the prior transect id.
						</li>
						<li>
							<h4>Fixed button to clear integer input</h4>
							<p>Clicking in the text box (In lieu of the stepper control) provides a gray x button which clears the input field, however it did not clear the data.
								Now the clear button returns the text value to its default, which could be nil or 0, but it could also be any other integer value.

						</li>
						<li>
							<h4>Supported importing of surveys</h4>
							<p>Old surveys or surveys from other iPads can be added by putting the *.obssurv folder (inside the *.poz file)
								in the documents directory in iTunes, or by opening a *.poz file from email or Safari.
								I cannot import *.poz files put in the iTunes folder, because that is where the exports are.
						</li>
						<li>
							<h4>Removed Angle/Distance settings from the settings app.</h4>
							<p>The settings can only be defined in the protocol file, which was best, and always used anyways.
						</li>
						<li>
							<h4>Support slashes in survey names</h4>
							<p>A slash in a survey name as seen as a folder separator, which caused the survey export to fail.
								Slashes are replaced by underscore in the file name.
						</li>
						<li>
							<h4>Auto split long long tracklogs at 1000 gps points</h4>
							<p>This prevents very very long polylines from getting created when the user does not stop observing.
								The long polylines could slow down input and drawing.  The split tracklogs have all the same attributes,
								and will appear the same in ArcMap, and can be merged if needed.
						</li>
						<li>
							<h4>Add Cancel button to attribute editing form</h4>
							<p>Default when dismissing the form is to save all edits.  This will close the form and discard edits.
								No warning is given.
						</li>
						<li>
							<h4>Observation selector uses label field</h4>
							<p>When you tap to select a feature, and multiple feature are available, you need to pick the feature you want from a list.
								Previously, you had to know the creation date to choose the one you wanted.
								Now if you have a your feature has a label, you can use the label to select the feature you want.
						</li>
						<li>
							<h4>Numerous bug fixes</h4>
							<p>Survey race conditions; Crashes with map loading, defaults not being recognized after upgrade
								Move to GPS point not always updating the display.  Duplicate graphics for a single feature.
								Crashed if you started data logging without a map. Deleting any map incorrectly cleared the map display.
								And lots more.
						</li>
						<li>
							<h4>Modernization of code for latest iOS versions</h4>
							<p>Lots of code cleanup and refactoring to support best practices for modern iOS code.
								Turned on all compiler warnings and eliminated all warnings.
								Removed dead and un-needed code.
						</li>
