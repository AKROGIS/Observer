				<h3>Major Changes</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<h4>Limit angles to a valid value</h4>
							<p>Previously, angles would wrap around 360 degrees, which incorrectly accepted typos.
								Now the angles are limited to the dead ahead bearing +/- 180 degrees. If the angle is
								not valid there is a system beep, the done button does not activate, and the text field maintains key focus.
						</li>
						<li>
							<h4>Single popover for Angle/Distance and Attributes</h4>
							<p>The transition to/from the Attribute editing form and the Angle/Distance form takes place in the
								same spot on the screen (in the same popover controller).  This speeds up and simplifies the transition
								from one to the other.
						</li>
						<li>
							<h4>Fixed Cancel/Done buttons on Angle/Distance editor</h4>
							<p>When editing an existing record, the Cancel/Done buttons on the Location editor closed <thead>
								the entire editing session instead of returning to Attribute editor.  This has been fixed.
							</thead>.
						</li>
						<li>
							<h4>Reduced the number of popover resizes.</h4>
							<p>The resizing for the keyboard is good (maybe annoying, but necessary) and shouldn't be mucked
								with. I eliminated all attempts to resize the popover as small as possible, as this rarely
								prevented a resize for the keyboard, and it resulted in a lot of unnecessary resizing when
								pushing/popping forms in the navigation stack.
						</li>
