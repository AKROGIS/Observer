	<h3>Beta Testing</h3>
	You are participating in a beta testing program.  Please understand the risks.
	<ul>
	  <li>
	    <strong>This app may crash at any time</strong><br/>
	    When you are connected to the network, a crash report will be sent to an online service so that I am aware of the problem (and hopefully fix it).
	    The crash report will not contain any personal data.  Complete details can be found <a href="http://try.crashlytics.com/terms/">here</a>.
	    A simplified version is at the bottom of this <a href="http://try.crashlytics.com/security/">page</a> (none of the optional items are collected for this app).<br/><br/>
	  </li>
	  <li>
	  <strong>You must upgrade</strong><br/>
	    Currently you will be required to upgrade whenever you are on the network and the app detects that a newer version is available.  The detection will happen automatically
	    and you will be notified when the upgrade is happening.  In a later version of the app, you will be notified when a new
	    version is available. However, you will be able to elect to defer the upgrade until a time of your choosing.<br/><br/>
</li>
	  <li>
	  <strong>You may lose data</strong><br/>
	  Emphasis has been placed on ensuring that the data you collect is always saved and safe.  However, you may lose data, that is why it is still in Beta.
	  All upgrades should preserve your data.  Please let me know if you experience any loss of data.<br/><br/>
<li>
	    <strong>No ability to save to server</strong><br/>
	    The data you collect will be visible and editable on the device, but at this point there is no ability to sync your data to the server for use in
	    ArcGIS or other analysis tools.  This feature will be rolled out during the beta testing, and will need to be tested by you.<br/><br/>
</li>
<li>
	    <strong>The protocol format is evolving</strong><br/>
	    Some pending features may require changes to the protocol file that defines your survey.  The app may, in turn, expect the newer protocol format and
	    crash with surveys based on an obsolete protocol file.  I will attempt to support older protocol formats if possible,
	    but that may not be a good use of my time.  By the final release, any changes to the protocol format will be tested to ensure they do not crash or break
	    the app.<br/><br/>
</li>
<li>
	    <strong>Tracking issues</strong><br/>
	    As I write this, there are 69 open issues (bugs, feature requests, and some random good/bad ideas).
	    The list will grow and hopefully shrink as we proceed to the final release.
	    You can track the open issues on <a href="https://github.com/regan-sarwas/Observer/issues">GitHub</a>.
	    If you have a new issue, or a comment on a existing issue, please email <a href="mailto:regan_sarwas@nps.gov">regan_sarwas@nps.gov</a>.
	    If you are reporting a bug, please include the version you are using. You can determine the
	    version by opening the device Settings, and selecting Park Collector.<br/><br/>
</li>
<li>
	    <strong>This list is incomplete</strong><br/>
	    I've tried to include everything you should be aware of, but I might have forgotten something.  Sorry.
	    I would have warned you if I could.<br/><br/>
</li>
	</ul>
	    <strong>Send your feedback!</strong><br/>
        Feedback is requested and very much appreciated.  This app is written for you, and it cannot be all you want without your input.
	    Please send any feedback to <a href="mailto:regan_sarwas@nps.gov">regan_sarwas@nps.gov</a>.<br/><br/>
