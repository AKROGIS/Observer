				<h3>Park Observer 2016</h3>
				<p>We have been working on Park Observer this spring, and we have some nice new feature.
					They are still in development, so we apppreciate any testing and feedback.
					The features are only available on version 0.9.8 or higher.
					(To check the version, open the Settings App and tap on Park Observer
					near the bottom of the list on the left.  <strong>NOTE</strong> There is
					a <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/32791771/542911">bug</a> in the Settings app
					if the Park Observer settings page is mostly blank, kill the settings app
					 (double click the home button and swipe up on the settings app) and try again.)
					Use the <a href="#installing-app">instructions below</a> to install the latest version.</p>
					<p>Some of the new features are:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<h4>Park Observer to ArcMap Tool</h4>
							<p>Export or email your Survey to an ArcGIS computer and build a
							file geodatabase of all your survey data.  No need to connect to
							the NPS network.
							<a href="#fgdb-export">More info...</a></p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<h4>Advanced Symbology</h4>
							<p>Lines and points in Park Observer can now use most of the symbology
							available to ArcGIS.  Observations can have different symbols and/or
							colors based on attributes of the observation.
							<a href="#advanced-symbology">More info...</a></p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<h4>Track Log Totalizer</h4>
							<p>Display a running time or distance by survey segment.
							<a href="#totalizer">More info...</a></p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<h4>Recording Indicator</h4>
							<p>User configurable text (via the protocol file) can be displayed
							on the map to indicate: "Recording but not observing" and "Observing (on Transect)"
							<a href="#footer">Contact us</a>, or see the
							<a href="ProtocolSpecificationV2.html">Protocol File Specifications</a> for more info.</p>
						</li>
					</ul>
					<p>We are also working on several other features we plan to have ready this spring:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<h4>Required Fields</h4>
							<p>Specify (via the protocol file), that selected fields must
							not be blank (nor contain 0) in order to close the form.  This
							feature should be used sparingly.  It violates the notion that
							the user is in charge of the app, and puts the app in charge of
							the user.
							<a href="#footer">Contact us</a>, or see the
							<a href="ProtocolSpecificationV2.html">Protocol File Specifications</a> for more info.</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<h4>Unique Identifier for Observations</h4>
							<p>Display a unique identifier for each observation at the top
								of the attribute entry popup.  This identifier may be a timestamp
								or a sequential number.  An option to label the observation on
								the map with this identifier is also under consideration.
						</li>
						<li>
							<h4>Background tracklogging</h4>
							<p>Currently the app does not get location updates if you
							switch to another app while recording.  This can be fixed.</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<h4>Move Buttons to the Top</h4>
							<p>Add an option via the Settings app to allow a user to decide
							if the button toolbar should be at the bottom (default) or at
							the top of the screen.</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<h4>Other</h4>
							<p>The full list of bugs, feature requests and other issues is
								available on <a href="https://github.com/regan-sarwas/Observer/issues">
									source code repository on github</a></p>
						</li>

				<h3>Installing the Upgrade</h3>
				<p>Until thes new features are finished and tested, version 0.9.7 will
				be the default over the air install from this web site.  This means
			you will need to install the app manually to use the latest features.</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Download the <a href="Park_Observer_beta.ipa">application package</a> to your computer.</li>
					<li>Follow the remainder of the instructions
						<a href="no-wifi.htm">Getting Started without Wifi</a>.</li>
						<li>Download the <a href="syncserver/ParkObserver.pyt">Park Observer Toolbox</a> for ArcMap.
						After downloading, move this file somewhere that is convenient for ArcCatalog to find.</li>
				</ol>
			</section>
			<section id="fgdb-export">
				<h3>View data in ArcMap</h3>
				<p>This feature is for those who cannot access to the Park Observer
					server on the NPS wireless network,
				and those that want to view/edit the data collected in ArcMap while still
			in the field.</p>
			<p>To use this feature you will need to <a href="#installing-app">upgrade the app</a>
				and install the Park Observer Toolbox on your ArcGIS PC.  The export file (*.poz)
			created with older (0.9.7 or earlier) versions of Park Observer is not
			compatible with ArcGIS.</p>
			<p>
				More complete instructions will be provided shortly (with screenshots and everything).
				In the meantime, the following should work for the intrepid.
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Install the latest version of the app, and the Park Observer Toolbox</li>
				<li>Tap on the survey button</li>
				<li>Tap on the share icon (square with up arrow) next to the survey to share</li>
				<li>Tap on <em>Share Survey with iTunes</em></li>
				<li>Connect your iPad to an ArcGIS PC</li>
				<li>Copy the survey file (*.poz) found in the Park Observer File Sharing
					area of iTunes (see <a href="no-wifi.htm">Getting Started without Wifi</a> for
					help on iTunes file sharing) to a folder on your PC.</li>
				<li>Open ArcCatalog</li>
				<li>In ArcCatalog, browse to the location where you saved the Park Observer
					Toolbox (ParkObserver.pyt) file downloaded in the first step.</li>
					<li>Open the toolbox and double click the <em>Survey to FGDB</em> tool.</li>
					<li>There is only one input to this tool: the poz file from step 6</li>
					<li>When the tool is done, it will have created a FGDB in the same folder
						as the survey (*.poz) file. The FGDB is named to match the survey protocol
						name and version</li>
					<li>The FGDB will include feature classes for the tracklogs, gps points,
						various kinds of observations and relationships among these various
						feature classes.  Just drag and drop all the feature classes into
						ArcMap and symbolize/select to your heart's content.</li>
			</ol>

			<section id="advanced-symbology">
				<h3>Advanced Symbology</h3>
				<p>Track log lines can now have differnt styles (dashed, dotted, etc).
				Observation points can now have different shapes, outlines, even icons.
			  All of the renderers and
				options describe <a href="http://resources.arcgis.com/en/help/rest/apiref/renderer.html">
				here</a> are supported.  The <a href="http://www.json.org">JSON</a> description of your
				desired symbology must be added to your upgraded protocol file.</p>
				<p><strong>Specifying <em>Unique Value</em> and <em>Class Break</em> renderers
				is supported, however a bug in the app is keeping the features from being rendered
				properly.  This should  be fixed soon.</strong>
				</p>
			<p>To use this feature you will need to <a href="#installing-app">upgrade the app</a>, and upgrade your protocol files.

			<a href="ProtocolSpecificationV2.html">Protocol File Specifications</a> for more info.</p>

			</section>
			<section id="totalizer">
				<h3>Transect Totalalizer</h3>
				<p>The totalizer puts text on the map in the upper left hand corner to
					show the duration spent under the current conditions.
					This text will not appear unless special instructions are included
				in your protocol file. The text can display the time or distance
				(in miles or kilometers) while observing, not observing or both.
				This duration is totaled for each value of a mission property attribute
				you select.
				For example if your survey collects a transect ID, you can
				display the distance covered so far observing on that transect line.
				</p>
				<p>To use this feature you will need to <a href="#installing-app">upgrade the app</a>, and upgrade your protocol files.
