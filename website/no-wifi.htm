				<h3>Getting Started without Wifi</h3>
				<p>These instructions are for those who cannot connect their iPad to the NPS wireless network.
					This process is a lot more tedious (and no better) than the over air solution.
					It is recommended that you only use this if you have no other option.</p>
				<p>These instructions are also for those with custom basemaps or protocols that are not in the list of
					<a href="maps/">existing basemap</a> or <a href="protocols/">existing protocol</a>.
					In this case, you only need to use <a href="#installing-basemaps">installing basemaps</a>
					or <a href="#installing-protocols">installing protocols</a>
					as necessary.
					<a href="#footer">Contact us</a> if you would like your custom basemap or protocol in the server list.</p>
