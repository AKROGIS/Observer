Protocol Files -- 1.x
=====================

*This document is for Park Observer 1.x.  If you are using Park Observer 2.0
please see [this version](Protocol_Guide_V2.html).* 

A protocol file is required to use the Park Observer.  It provides the standard for a data collection effort,
and defines the schema for the GIS database on the server.
You can create your own protocol file if you follow the specification, however this is the file format is very picky,
and it is easier (and recommended) to get help from the AKR GIS Team.

This document discusses some of the considerations in making a protocol file suitable for your survey needs.
It is not the definitive guide to exactly what is allowed in the content and
format of a protocol file.  For that, see the [Protocol Specifications](Protocol_Specification_V1.html).

Basic Definition
----------------
A protocol file is defined by a name and a version.  The name and version are used to sync to the GIS database on the server,
so the name should reflect the scope of the protocol, and the version is used to distinguish changes over time.

A protocol has a description, which should include some information helpful for someone browsing protocols to select the
appropriate protocol for their survey.  Contact information for the primary user of the protocol is usually included in the description.

The protocol defines the list of attributes tracked during a mission (called mission properties)

The protocol defines the list of features (and their attributes) that are observered during a survey.
Most survey are limited to a single feature (animal).

Name and Version
----------------

A Protocol should have a unique name and version.  To avoid confusion, the file name should match the name attribute
inside the file, but this is not required.
Protocols have a major and minor version number.  Both are integers separated by a decimal point.
A change in the major version number indicates a change in the database schema.  Use the minor version number for all other changes.

When a survey is upload to the server, or the POZ2FGDB toolbox is used, the protocol used to create the survey
determines then name of the database that is created (or appended).
The name of the database is determined by the protocol name and the major version number.  If the database exists
then the survey is added to the tables in the database. Therefore it is important to increase the major version
number of your protocol if you add, remove, rename, or change the type of any of your attributes (i.e. change the
database schema). The world may end if you try to sync two different surveys with different schemas, but the same
protocol name and major version number.
Please don't do that.

Mission Properties
------------------


Features
--------


Attributes
----------
Attributes can be text, numbers, or boolean (true/false).
Date/time and locations are captured automatically for all observations.
Forms can use:
  * step controls (+/-) (useful for small integers)
  * switches (used for yes/no values)
  * single line text
  * multiline text
  * number entry (with zero or more digits after the decimal)
  * picklists (see discussion below)


PickLists
---------
  * Text vs. Integer – The underlying database type for a picklist can either be text (i.e. the text displayed in the picklist display),
  or an integer (0 for the first item in the list, 1 for the second item, etc).  The choice of integer vs. text is an important early distinction,
  as this can’t be changed later without creating a new database.  Integers are more convenient/efficient for searching, sorting, and validating;
  however text is more obvious to humans.  If the database is exported to a CSV file, integers are not expanded to the text value.
  This makes the CSV files smaller, but harder to understand.  If Integers are used, then a domain (picklist) is automatically created in the
  protocol’s FGDB to match the picklist values.  Currently, picklists are not created in the FGDB if the data is stored as text (I hope to
  remove this restriction the future).

  * Default/Initial Value – If a default value is specified, then the form will be pre-populated with that item selected from the picklist.
  The appropriate value will be recorded in the database without additional action from the user.  If no default value is specified, then
  that item in the form will be blank.  The database will record a null (empty) value if the data type is text, or -1 if the data type is integer.
  Once a value is selected, it is not possible to clear the selection, and you must pick one of the items in the picklist.

  * Ordering – The Items in the picklist will be ordered (top to bottom) in the order that you provided them


Locations
---------

What types of locations do you want to allow/require? Your choices are:

 * At the GPS location

 * At the map touch

 * At the target on the map

 * At an angle/distance from the current GPS location/course

By default, the first three are allowed, and none is required.
GPS is the default unless you touch the map.
If you want angle/distance, you can specify the distance units, and angle convention.

features located with Map touch or map target can both be moved by dragging the marker
on the map, or by snapping it to the current GPS location.
features located by GPS or Angle/Distance cannot be moved.

If a touch location method is allowed, a feature will be created where the user touches the map.
If multiple features allow touch location, then a picklist will be displayed to select the feature to create.

If a feature allows one or more non-touch location methods, then a button with the name of the feature is added to the user interface. If there is only one allowed non-touch location method, then tapping the button adds the feature with that location method. If more than one non-touch location method is allowed, then button has the following behavior:

  * Tap:
    - If there is a default non-touch location method, then:
      + use that location method to add a new feature.
    - If there is no default non-touch location method, then:
      + If the feature's preferred location method (see Long Press) is not set, then:
        * set the feature's preferred method to the first of [GPS, Target, Angle/Distance] to be allowed.
      + Use the feature's preferred location method to add the new feature.
  * Long Press:
    - Provide the user with a selection list of all the allowed non-touch location methods.
    - If the user selects one, then:
      + A feature is added using the selected location method.
      + Set the feature's preferred location method to the selected location method.

============ From specs

Any location type containing the text "Touch" is a touch location, the others are non-touch locations.
If a touch location method is allowed then a feature will be created when the
user taps the map without selecting an existing feature.
If one or more non-touch location methods are allowed, then an
_Add Feature_ button is added to the user interface.

The _Add Feature_ button has the following behavior if more than one non-touch location method is allowed:
* **Tap:**
If there is a location method with `"default":true`
use that location method to add a new feature.
If there is no location method with `"default":true` and
if the feature's preferred location method (see Long Press) is not set, then
set the feature's preferred method to the first of the following types to be allowed
`gps`, `adhocTarget`, `angleDistance`.
Use the user's preferred location method to add a new feature

* **Long Press:**
Provide the user with a selection list of all the allowed non-touch location methods.
If the user selects one then a feature is added using the selected location method, and the selected location method is set as the user's preference.

#### gps
The feature is located at the current GPS position.  These observations cannot be moved.

#### mapTarget
The feature is located at the point on the map under the target (cross-hairs) at the center
of the device screen.  These observations can be moved.

#### mapTouch
The feature is located at the point on the map where the user taps.  These observations can be moved.

#### angleDistance
The feature is located a certain angle (relative to the forward motion of the GPS, or the north if not moving) and distance from the current GPS position.  These observations cannot be moved.

GPS cannot be moved.  angledistance can be moved by editing the angle/distance. mapTouch and mapTarget can be
moved to the current GPS location(and subsequently not moved) or moved to an arbitrary touch on the map.

Symbology
---------

The protocol file specifies symbology:

 * Tracklogs - different colors and/or lineweight while observing and not observing

 * features - color and size (they are always circles)

 * points where mission properties are set - color and size (they are always circles)

**Note** The track log start and stop points will be drawn on top of the
gps points, which are drawn on top of the track log lines. This will affect
the display of the symbols, and therefore how you might choose your symbology.
